This project is a vomit pass at tracking the constantly evolving relationship between rap music and fashion.  As flavors change from Cazel's and shell-toes in the nascent days of rap (think Run DMC) to the modern obsessions with Hedi Silmane and Yeezy boosts (think, our lord and savior, Yeezus), we though it would be cool to be able to quantitatively track fashion trends and popularity as it applies to rap culture.
