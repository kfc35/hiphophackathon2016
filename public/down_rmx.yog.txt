Artist: Yo Gotti f/ Nicki Minaj
Album:  The Art of Hustle
Song:   Down in the DM (Remix)
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Yo Gotti]
If she respond to this DM, boy you fucked up
She took your pictures off her 'Gram, y'all must have broke up
First she love you, then she blocked you, boy that's fucked up
It's the remix and you know what's up

Aye it go, it goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go... down)

I tell her
Snapchat me that pussy...mood
Or Facetime me that pussy if it's...cool
(Whoo) Boy, my DM poppin' (DM poppin')
My DM just caught a body
If you screenshottin', you the police
10 likes, you want OD
Follow shawty then unfollow
Then follow back, that's so me
She's like, "I killed 'em, bitch I killed 'em, really killed 'em"
Bitch you wouldn't look like that if you undo all them filters
And angles

I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her DM
All eyes, yeah I see 'em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)

[Nicki Minaj]
Your dick ain't good enough to be stylin' on me
You's a bitch ass nigga to keep on wildin' on me
Hit my side nigga, quick, fast, pull up in that quick, fast
I ain't talkin' pancakes, but he flip a brick fast
A bunch of bad bitches, ain't doin' the dab, bitches
Do be in some gangs, couple Cs on their bag, bitches
Fuck you mean? Fuck your little memes
Even Queen Bey had to tell 'em I'm the queen
Check the D, blessed indeed
The executive producer, bitch, rest in peace
Then he put his hands in my pants
Felt them thick lips and got wood
He said, "Kylie wuss good?"
I said, "Miley wuss good?"
I said, "Could you pay my bills like O'Reilly? Wuss good?"
I just sit back and observe
All these niggas that I done curved
If it go down in your DM then baby boy, you lucky
Cause 99.9% of these fuckboys can't fuck me

[Yo Gotti]
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go... down)

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I seen your man post a quote and a pic in bed
So I hit him in the DM like, "Hey bighead
'Member when I was your woman crush?" He said, "Yeah"
Told him that I'm headed home, he could meet me there
Try to beat me there, let me be clear
Is you eatin' ass too? Nigga, pinky swear
I'm just lookin' for a dude that could eat the twat
Do he make more dough than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head than Peggy Bundy?
Man fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, "What you like about me?" He said, "That your ass fat"
He said would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack
He said that it's abstract, he said, "Joe yo ass crack!"
I told him I never front and then I threw that ass back

[Yo Gotti]
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go... down)

I tell her...
Snapchat me that pussy (mood)
Snapchat me that pussy if it's...cool
Snapchat me that pussy (mood)
Snapchat me that pussy if it's...cool
I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her DM
All eyes, yeah I see 'em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go... down)</pre>
