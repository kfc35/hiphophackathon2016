Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I see your girl post her bm, so I hit her in her dm
All eyes yeah I see'em, yeah this your man I hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the Dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down, it go... down)
It goes down in the dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down, it go... down)

I tell her, snapchat me that pussy or facetime me that pussy if it's cool
(Whoo) boy my dm poppin, (dm poppin) my dm just caught a body
I got celeb's in this dm, they breaking news if they see them
But naw we don't do no talking
(We don't do no talking), we see sucker shit too often (fuck niqqa)

I see your girl post her bm, so I hit her in her dm
All eyes yeah I see'em, yeah this your man I hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the Dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down), it go... down)
It goes down in the dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down), it go... down)

I tell her, don't you hate when you get screenshot (petty)
Bitch that dm wasn't for everybody (rules) I love tha gram I love tha gram
(I love tha gram) I'm addicted to it I know I am (I know I am) and I just followed Angela Simmons
Boy I got a crush on Angela Simmons they like "damn gotti you bold" fuck it I'm a let the world know
Goals

I see your girl post her bm, so I hit her in her dm
All eyes yeah I see'em, yeah this your man I hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the Dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down, it go... down)
It goes down in the dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down, it go... down)

I tell her, snapchat me that pussy, snapchat me that pussy if it's cool
I see your girl post her bm, so I hit her in her dm
All eyes yeah I see'em, yeah this your man I hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the Dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down, it go... down)
It goes down in the dm (it go down) it go down in the dm (it go down, it go... down)
I tell her</pre>
