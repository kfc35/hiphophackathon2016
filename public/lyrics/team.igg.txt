Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Turn me up, break the knob right
I get dressed like it's prom night
I feed them lemons in the limelight
They say I'm full, lost my appetite?!
(Hell nah) Keep on pushing like a dealer
(Hell nah) Keep on shooting, Reggie Miller
(Hell nah) Go and give 'em all the finger
You gotta set the score right, call it Hans Zimmer
My time wherever I gooo...
I took a chance like I'm from Chicagooo...
100+ in that Murcielagooo...
Bout to go ape, hey! Turn it to the congooo...

Baby I got me
Baby I got me
And that's all I need
Yeah that's all I need
Baby I got me
Only friend I need
Playing on my team
Is someone like...

Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you fucking with the team?

Outchea, pronto
Hit 'em with the dose, that's a combo
Running through ya block, no fumble
Bout to kill 'em all, where the shovel?
See I gotta go for mine
Benja-jammin' - that money on my mind
Jamaican club, I'm stayin' on the grind
Dutty wine, don't step on this land mine!
Ven aqui, andele
You tryna take flight? Do what I say
100+ vogues on the highway
Watch a new car dash, call me Kylie

Baby I got me
Baby I got me
And that's all I need
Yeah that's all I need
Baby I got me
Only friend I need
Playing on my team
Is someone like...

Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you fucking with the team?

Are you workin' with some cash here, cash here?
100,000 on the dash yeah, dash yeah
All my ladies shake it fast yeah, fast yeah
Now vogue on that ass, yup! Yeah we in here

Baby I got me
Baby I got me
And that's all I need
Yeah that's all I need
Baby I got me
Only friend I need
Playing on my team
Is someone like...

Me, baby, no way
Watch me while I do my thing
Oh, baby, no way
Are you fucking with the team?

Team, team
Team, team
Are you fuckin' with the team?

Are you fuckin' with the team?
Are you fuckin' with the team?</pre>
