[Macklemore]
I went to the moped store, and said fuck it
Salesman's like "What up, what's your budget?"
And I'm like "Honestly, I don't know nothin about mopeds"
He said "I got the one for you, follow me"
Oooohhhh~! It's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal!
I'm headed

[Macklemore + old school guest stars chiming in]
Downtown, cruisin through the alley
Tip-toein in the street like "dale"
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls, on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill
And all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little momma with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Macklemore]
Killin the game 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, dookie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch
Birdman, God damn, man everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stuntin on everybody, hella raw, pass the wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost draggin upon the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lyin it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped man~!
She got 1988, Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwin up the Westside as we throw it in the air
Stopped by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Chorus: Ryan Lewis] + (old school stars)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep us safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
of the leather seat between your legs
Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey
Downtown! You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy, better follow me towards
Downtown! What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl, ain't seen nothin yet until you're
Downtown

[Macklemore + old school guest stars]
Dope! Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet
Beyow!! You can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a b-boy stance, I'm not dancin
I got your girl on the back goin tandem
Because I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yellin out "Who that is?"

[Macklemore]
It's me - the M the A-C the K
Stunting like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pandore and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watchin me
I do a handstand, an eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't no big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listenin to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yellin at me like "You need to slow down"
Going thirty-eight, damn! Chill the fuck out!
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down~!!!
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruisin down Broadway girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coattail drag but I ain't tearin my suit, tearin my suit

[Chorus]

[Outro + extra stars]
You don't want no beef boy
Know I run the streets boy
Better follow me towards (Downtown)
What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl, ain't seen nothin yet until you're
(Downtown)</pre>
