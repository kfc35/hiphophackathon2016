  "songTitle": "Through the Wire",
  "intro": "Yo Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?/I spit it through the wire, man/There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man/I'd gladly risk it all right now/It's a life-or-death situation, man/Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now/It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?",
  "verse1": "I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert/Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp/That right there could drive a sane man berserk/Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk/How do you console my mom or give her light support/Telling her her son's on life support?/And just imagine how my girl feel/On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till/She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine/She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign/No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed/Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines/In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died/The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man/Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band/I swear this right here, history in the making, man",
  "bridge 1": "I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man/They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks/Y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw/I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it/But I'm still here for y'all right now, man/This what I got to say right here, dawg",
  "verse2": "What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal/On the hottest rap label around?/But he wasn't talking about coke and birds/It was more like spoken word/Except he's really putting it down?/And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory/And what we need to do in the game/Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time/In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed/If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt/Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt!/I swear to God driver two wants to sue/I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe/My dawgs couldn't tell if I/Looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised/There's been an accident like GEICO/They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael/I must got a angel/Cause look how death missed his ass/Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?/Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past/Toys \"R\" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash/And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid/Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did/But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph/Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire",
  "outro": "Y'know what I'm saying?/When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said/\"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?/It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!\" Haha/She can't be serious, man"
