  "songTitle": "The New Workout Plan",
  "intro": "You just popped in the Kanye West/Get Right for the Summer workout tape/And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly/You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player/Man, at least a dude with a car/So first of all we gonna work on the stomach/Nobody wants a little tight ass",
  "verse1": "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and/Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this/Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave/Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed/Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed/It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited/Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick/What's scary to me is/Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me/So excuse me miss, I forgot your name/Thank you, God bless you, good night I came",
  "chorus1": "It's been a week without me/And she feel weak without me/She wanna talk it out but/Ain't nothing to talk about/Unless she's talking about freaking out/Then maybe we can work it out",
  "verse2": "Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette/My name Kanye from the Jigga set/Twista said \"Get It Wet\"/Ooh girl your breath is harsh!/Cover your mouth up like you got SARS/Off them tracks yea I bought them cars/Still kill a nigga on 16 bars/We ain't sweating to the oldies/We juking to a cold beat/Maybe one day girl we can bone/So you can brag to all your homies now/But I still mess with a big girl/If you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl/1 and you brought 2 friends/OK, 3 more now hop in the Benz/4-door - do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8/All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates/You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating/Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas",
  "chorus2": "It's been a week without me/And she feel weak without me/She wanna talk it out but/Ain't nothing to talk about/Unless she's talking about freaking out/Then maybe we can work it out",
  "outro": "Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to/Kanye's workout plan. I was able to pull a NBA player/And like now I shop every day on Rodeo Drive/I just want to say, thank you Kanye! Woooo! Woooo! Woooo!/My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say/That ever since listening to Kanye's workout tape/I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds and 13's/Put up in my Cavalier and I was able to get a free trip to Cancun/And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck with Ray-Ray's/Broke ass no mo'/My name is Ella-May from Mobile, Alabama/And I just want to say since listening to Kanye's workout tape/I been able to date outside the family, I got a double wide/And I rode the plane, rode the plane, rode the plane/Thanks to Kanye's workout plan/I'm the envy of all my friends/See I pulled me a baller man/And I ain't gotta work at the mall again/I wanna see you work out/It's like that old Michael Jackson shit/That's right put in work, move your ass, go berserk/Eat your salad, no dessert/Get that man you deserve/It's Kanye's workout plan"
