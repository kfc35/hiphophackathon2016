  "songTitle": "Spaceship",
  "chorus1": "I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky/I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky",
  "verse1": "If my manager insults me again/I will be assaulting him/After I fuck the manager up/Then I'm gonna shorten the register up/Let's go back, back to the Gap/Look at my check, wasn't no scratch/So if I stole, wasn't my fault/Yeah I stole, never got caught/They take me to the back and pat me/Askin' me about some khakis/But let some black people walk in/I bet you they show off their token blackie/Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store/So I'm on break next to the \"No Smokin'\" sign with a blunt in the mall/Takin' my hits, writing my hits/Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind/This fuckin' job can't help him/So I quit, y'all welcome/Y'all don't know my struggle/Y'all can't match my hustle/You can't catch my hustle/You can't fathom my love dude/Lock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers/That's a Different World like Cree Summer's/I deserve to do these numbers/\"The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!\"/So many records in my basement/I'm just waiting on my spaceship",
  "chorus2": "I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky/I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky",
  "verse2": "And I didn't even try to work a job/Represent the mob/At the same time thirsty on the grind/Chi state of mind/Lost my momma, lost my mind/Life my love, that's not mine/\"Why you ain't signed?\"/Wasn't my time/Leave me alone, work for y'all/Half of it's yours, half of it's mine/Only one to ball/Never one to fall/Got to get mine/Got to take mine/Got a Tec-9/Reach my prime/Got to make these haters respect mine/In the mall until 12 when my schedule had said 9/Putting them pants on shelves/Waiting patiently I ask myself/Where I want to go, where I want to be/Life is much more than running in the streets/Holla at 'Ye, hit me with the beat/Put me on my feet/Sound so sweet/Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee/Staying low key, nope/Holler at God \"Man why'd you have to take my folks?\"/Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G/Love my G, Rolly G/Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's/Got a lot of people counting on me/And I'm just trying to find my peace/Should've finished school like my niece/Then I finally wouldn't use my piece (blaw!)",
  "chorus3": "I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky/I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky",
  "verse3": "I remember having to take the dollar cab/Coming home real late at night/Standing on my feet all damn day/Trying to make this thing right/And having one of my co-workers say \"Yo, you look just like/This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night\"/Well easy come, easy go, how that saying goes/No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows/I had all that snatched from me/A&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me/And didn't want to hear a rap from me/So naturally actually had to face things factually/Had to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me/Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair/I don't want to ever go back there/So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off",
  "chorus4": "I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky/I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit/I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky",
  "outro": "I want to fly, I want to fly/I said I want my chariot to pick me up/And take me, brother, for a ride"
