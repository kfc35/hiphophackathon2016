  "songTitle": "Family Business",
  "intro": "How's your son? (all the things)/He made the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)/Aight, they said he wasn't tall enough/(...all that glitters is not gold/And all gold is not reality/Real is what you lays on me)/Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?/That's a new girlfriend?",
  "verse1": "This is family business/And this is for the family that can't be with us/And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us/This why I spit it in my songs so sweet/Like a photo of your granny's picture/Now that you're gone it hit us/Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right/Yeah you heard the track I did man, \"This Can't Be Life\"/Somebody please say grace so I can save face/And have a reason to cover my face/I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it/Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it/When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?/As kids we used to laugh/Who knew that life would move this fast?/Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?/And look, tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it/And if you did, then that's family business",
  "chorus1": "And I don't care 'bout (all the diamond rings)/They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)/All these fancy things/I tell you that all (all that glitters is not gold, now gold is not reality)/Now all I know I know all these things (real is what you lease on me)",
  "verse2": "This is family business/And this is for everybody standing with us/Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture/Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?/Now she like \"See, that's my cousin on TV!\"/Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it/And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite/I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider/But when we get together be electric slidin'/Grandma, get 'em shook up/Aw naw, don't open the photo book up/I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name/But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane/You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude/But every holiday nobody eating her food/And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins/Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins/Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins/Fit 3 in the bed while 6 of y'all/I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg/But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed",
  "bridge": "Rain, rain, rain go away/Let the sun come out and all the children say/Rain, rain, rain go away/Let the sun come out and all the children say",
  "verse3": "I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind/A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns/Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God/And keep your face to the risin' sun/All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog/And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog/I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog/You can still love your man and be manly, dog/You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'/Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman/Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?/The second she storm out then he storm in/Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion/And drink some wine like Communion/And act like everything fine and if it isn't/We ain't letting everybody in our family business",
  "outro": "CLK Mercedes Benz/A whole lotta money/Mommy and Daddy, will you please stop fighting?/Let's get Stevie outta jail"
