  "intro": "Oh yeah, I've got the perfect song for the kids to sing/And all my people that's...",
  "chorus1": "Drug dealin' just to get by/Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high/(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)/We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25/Joke's on you, we still alive/Throw your hands up in the sky and say:/\"We don't care what people say\"",
  "verse1": "If this is your first time hearin' this/You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man/We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted/Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man/But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman/Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man/Flickin' Starter coats, man/Man, you don't know, man/We don't care what people say/This is for my niggas outside all winter/Cause this summer they ain't finna say: \"next summer I'm finna\"/Sittin' in the hood like community colleges/This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship/Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition/And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home/So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job/You gotta do somethin' man, your ass is grown",
  "chorus2": "Drug dealin' just to get by/Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high/(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)/We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25/Joke's on you, we still alive/Throw your hands up in the sky and say:/\"We don't care what people say\"",
  "verse2": "The second verse is for my dogs workin' 9 to 5 that still hustle/Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55/And everybody sellin' makeup, Jacob's/And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up/We put shit on layaway, then come back/We claim other people kids on our income tax/We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid/And we don't care what people say/Momma say she wanna move South/Scratchin' lottery tickets, eyes on a new house/'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house/Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work/He figured he'd take work/The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight/A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight/But we gon' keep bakin' til the day we get cake/And \"we don't care what people say\"",
  "chorus3": "Drug dealin' just to get by/Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high/(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)/We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25/Joke's on you, we still alive/Throw your hands up in the sky and say:/\"We don't care what people say\"",
  "verse3": "You know the kids gon' act a fool/When you stop the programs for after school/And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic/They favorite 50 Cent song \"12 Questions\"/We scream: \"rocks, blow, weed, park\", see, now we smart/We ain't retards, the way teachers thought/Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash/Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class/Sad enough we on welfare/They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair/I'm tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here/They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here/Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us/When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance/Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us/But \"we don't care what people say\"/My niggas",
  "chorus4": "Drug dealin' just to get by/Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high/(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)/We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25/Joke's on you, we still alive/Throw your hands up in the sky and say:/\"We don't care what people say\""
