[Intro/Chorus: French Montana]
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up, all the way up
I'm all the way up, I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Chorus Two: French Montana]
Shorty what'chu want, shorty what'chu need
My niggaz runnin game and we ain't never leavin
Countin up this money, we ain't never sleepin
You got V12, I got 12 V's
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (I'm all the way up)
Shorty what'chu want, I got what'chu need (need)
Shorty what'chu want, I got what'chu need (hahhh)
shorty what'chu want, I got what'chu need (I'm all the way up)

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe] + (French Montana)
For my niggaz with Bentley Coupes and Rolexes
Kicked the bitch out the room and gave her no breakfast
Had to stash the jewels, these bitches so reckless
Keep my hoes on cruise, I'm talkin Naughty "Uptown"
Showin off in new things
Couldn't take it off so I gave her un ching
Called me top shotta, yeah I keep a few t'ings
Cham-pi-on sound, yeah I got a few rings and
(I'm all the way up - and you can stay up)
And if you ask anybody where I live
Then point to the Hills and say... (go all the way up)
(Go all the way up)
(I'm all the way up, I'm all the way up)
(Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up)

[Remy Ma] + (French Montana)
Just left a big house to a BIGGER house
Ain't have a girlfriend but the BIIITCH is out
Chanel croc bags, shit ain't EVENNN out
With the gold chains, Himalayan Birkin cocaine
Lit it up, 'Pac shit, I "Hit 'Em Up"
I'm talkin color money, purple yin, and blue derm
I got brown lira, I ain't talkin 'bout Ross bitch
I'm that nigga on Viagra dick - that means I'm all the way up!
And you can stay up!
P.O. say I can't get high, hop in the helicopter
Ooh we're bad - go all the way up!
Go all the way up!
(I'm all the way up, I'm all the way up)
(Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up)
